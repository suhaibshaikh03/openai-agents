The Handoff Example project illustrates a simple yet effective approach to implementing a handoff mechanism. It includes components to simulate the sender, receiver, and any intermediary processes, ensuring data integrity and clear communication during the transfer.

This project can be used as a reference for:

Task handoff between team members or departments.
Data transfer between microservices or APIs.
Workflow automation involving multiple systems.
